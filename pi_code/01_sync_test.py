# 01_sync_test.py â€” emits a 1 ms TTL pulse on GP13 once per second and prints the
# microsecond timestamp at the start of each pulse ("SYNC <t_us>"). Use this to
# verify sync timing with a scope/logic analyzer or to drive external systems.
# Wiring: GP13 = sync out (3.3 V logic), connect grounds in common.
# Notes: Busy-wait is used only for the short pulse width; the 1 s period uses sleep.
